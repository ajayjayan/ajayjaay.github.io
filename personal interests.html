			<h1>Personal life and hobbies</h1>

	         <p>I am shy and I have trouble interacting with people. My first impression might not be the best impression for some. But that doesn't mean that I am not fun to be with. I am compassionate and easy going. I think I am funny at times but I don't know, you decide that once you get to know me.</p><br>
	         <p>I love football and I am a life long Manchester United fan. My favorite player is Cristiano Ronaldo and it is because of him that I started watching football. Though he left Man Utd, I couldn't bring myself to support another football club. I actively follow Manchester United on social media and regurlarly watch their games on tv. I also keep tabs on the other leagues happening in Europe.</p><br>
	         <p>I am also into cars and bikes and I love travelling. I believe that if you want to learn and find yourself, you must travel wherever and whenever you can. I currently own a Pulsar NS200 which I think the world of. I think that it represents my character in so many ways. We share a special bond.</p><br>
	         <p>I watch standup comedies and my favorite comedian is Kenny Sebastian. He's quirky, has great content and his   observations and mannerisms are spot on</p><br>
